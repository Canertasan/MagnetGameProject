# MagnetGameProject
Basic Magnet and metal simulation game. I tried to applied Gilbert's Model. Magnet is pulling metals if magnet is powerful enough. This game has just 1 level. Maybe in the future i will add more level to it. We can make it harder with designing some maps with wall and some out of range places. For that i need to work with level designer or i will start the work on my self. Game just has 1 level and some text, button UI, also restart button and some scripts in it. 


# Multiple Magnets
I did not code multiple magnet, because i did not figure out physics part. I did not understand how to divide a magnet in two pieces. and physics behind it. Even in magnet - metal interaction force calculation was hard.
